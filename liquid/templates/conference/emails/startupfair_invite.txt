My name is {{ user.get_full_name }} and I am part of Founders, a student entrepreneurship group at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

I am contacting you to see if {{ company.company_name }} is interested in participating.

The Reflections | Projections conference is a student-run event which brings together over 800 students from the Midwest to attend a variety of speaking events and computing workshops held throughout the weekend.

The Startup Fair will be held on October 1st, 2015 from 5-8PM in the Siebel Center atrium. The price for a Startup Fair booth is $400.
